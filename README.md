A Chrome extension to find the GitHub repository for a site hosted on GitHub pages

[**INSTALL**][install] | [**CHANGELOG**](CHANGELOG.md)

## How do I use it?

Click the extension icon to check a website.

Here's a site you can use to try it out: https://sidneynemzer.github.io/casual-minesweeper/

Websites using a custom domain (something other than "github.io") are harder to check, so the extension may not always correctly identify them.

Here's a site that uses a custom domain you can try it on: https://enlighteningfacts.com
