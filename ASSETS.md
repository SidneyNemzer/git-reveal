# Types of Assets

GIT REVEAL has two kinds of assets:

1. **Runtime Assets:** static files used at runtime. These are stored in `assets/`.
2. **Store Assets:** images shown in the Chrome Web Store. These are stored in `images/`.

Most of the store assets aren't commited to the repo since they aren't needed when developing or building.
